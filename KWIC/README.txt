HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT:
1. Run the script
2. Enter 1, 2, or 3 to input to console, text, or quit script respectively
3. Enter 1, 2, or 3 to output to console, text, or quit script respectively
4. If input is text file, enter the file name. It must be in the project folder so under the KWIC folder (KWIC/*.txt).
5. If output is text file, enter the file name to create/write to. It will output to the project folder so under the KWIC folder (KWIC/*.txt).
6. The script will store, circular shift, alphabetize, and then output to the respective choice.


Potential Errors/Assumptions: 
I assume permission to read/write to the project folder is allowed. Script has not been tested when permission is not granted when reading or writing to a text file. 

I remove all punctuations. This includes contractions. EX:
INPUT: Let's Go.
CHANGED TO: Lets Go

NOTE ON UML:
UML autogenerated by ObjectAid. Looking at my UML it shows that my associations are optional relations with 0..1 multiplicity. I am not sure why that is the case. Perhaps my implementation is incorrect and would like someone to comment on that if possible.

Strategy Pattern: 
The strategy pattern is applied to the Input and Output.
Context: InputContext and OutputContext
Strategy: Input and Output
Concrete Strategies: ConsoleInput, FileInput, ConsoleOutput, FileOutput
The strategy pattern asks the user for the configurations at runtime and the context class chooses the requested type of input and output.
